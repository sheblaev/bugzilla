# Slightly patched bugzilla

I could not make bugzilla 5.\* to use ProductDashboad extention from BMO. 

But is looks so cute for management (sic!) that I had to patch bugzilla 5.0. Will put here other patches too.

I'm new with git, so failed to fork/branch bugzilla's repository and made a copy instead. Sorry. If you can hsow me right way, welcome!
